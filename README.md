## Client did not pay?


Add opacity to the body tag and decrease it every day until their site completely fades away. Set a due date and customize the number of days you offer them until the website is fully vanished. 


```javascript
/* change these variables as you wish */
	var due_date = new Date('2019-02-05')
	var days_deadline = 5
/* stop changing here */
```

PS: Next time use [letsdeel.com](https://letsdeel.com ) to make sure you get paid.

## Usage
Just load the not-paid.js file in ```<head>```.
Set the variable ```in_debt``` to ```true``` if the client is in debt, and, if he makes the payment, set to ```false```.
